## hopcroft-karp

### Overview

This project consists of an implementation of the Hopcroft Karp algorithm to obtain the maximum matching of a bipartite graph.  According to Konigs Theorem, the maximum matching is equivalent to the minimum vertex cover.

Forked from https://github.com/rihuber/ and modified to decouple from other project classes and implement generics for increased modularity.
