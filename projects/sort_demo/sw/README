----------------------

This directory contains all necessary files to generate the software libraries
and executables for the "sort" example application. Be sure to build the
hardware part first. See ../hw/README for details on how to do that.

When the hardware part is built, make sure your environment is set correctly,
especially the HW_DESIGN variable (it needs to be set to the absolute path
to the ../hw/edk-static directory). See ../settings.sh for the correct
setting.
See http://www.reconos.de/twiki/bin/view/ReconOS/SetupEnvironment for details.

    - Run 'make setup' to build the eCos library.
    - Run 'make pc' to build the executables for your workstation.
    - Run 'make ecos' to build the executables for the ReconOS/eCos system,
      using the eCos API.
    - Run 'make posix' to build the executables for the ReconOS/eCos system,
      using the POSIX API.
    - Use the XMD to upload the executables to the XUP board.
    
There are nine executables in total:

    sort_pc_st			single-threaded version for destop PC
    sort_ecos_st_sw		eCos API, single-threaded software version
    sort_ecos_st_hw		eCos API, single-threaded hardware version
    sort_ecos_mt_sw		eCos API, multi-threaded software version
    sort_ecos_mt_hw		eCos API, multi-threaded hardware version
    sort_posix_st_sw		POSIX API, single-threaded software version
    sort_posix_st_hw		POSIX API, single-threaded hardware version
    sort_posix_mt_sw		POSIX API, multi-threaded software version
    sort_posix_mt_hw		POSIX API, multi-threaded hardware version
    
Use 'config.h' to set up the application parameters.
